							<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>et to the f---ing stadium. I got to pitch." Decades later, Dock Ellis remembered it like this: sitting in a taxi outside the San Diego airport, running late for work, tripping on acid.</p>

							<p>So yeah, maybe the words aren't verbatim.</p>

							<p>It was a Friday. That much is certain. June 12, 1970. Three years after psychedelic Pied Piper Timothy Leary invited America to "Turn on, tune in and drop out." Four years before Richard Nixon's resignation marked an inglorious denouement
								to
								the counterculture era. The middle of things. A purple haze. The perfect moment for the first and only known no-hitter in major league history pitched under the influence of lysergic acid diethylamide, thrown by the first and only player in
								major league history to inspire both a biography penned by a future American poet laureate and a seminal article in High Times.</p>

							<p>Six hours earlier, Ellis had been in Los Angeles, nursing a hangover, dazed and confused, enjoying what he thought was his day off.</p>

							<p>Two hours later, he would be standing on the mound at San Diego Stadium, throwing baseballs he couldn't always feel, in the general direction of batters he didn't always see, trying very, very hard not to fall over.</p>

							<p>He was 25 years old, a right-handed starter for the Pittsburgh Pirates, armed with a big curveball and a bigger mouth, a tall, chubby-faced kid who ran like a fawn. Clubhouse cutup. Media antagonist. Iconoclastic cultural badass. In the
								words of a teammate, "not afraid of nothing."</p>

							<p>The Pirates were in town to play the San Diego Padres, starting their first West Coast trip of the season. That, too, is certain. The rest is a matter of memory, largely Ellis', imperfect and addled, culled from interviews, articles and
								books. The club arrived on Thursday, an off day. Ellis rented a car. Dropped a tab of acid. Drove north to his hometown, Los Angeles. He showed up at the home of Mitzi, the girlfriend of an old childhood buddy, Al Rambo.</p>

							<p>"Dock," Mitzi asked, "what's wrong?"</p>

							<p>"I'm as high as a Georgia pine," he said.</p>

							<p>The two drank screwdrivers. Smoked marijuana. Talked through the night. Eventually, Ellis fell asleep. Possibly for an hour. Probably less. Around noon -- maybe earlier -- he took another dose of LSD.</p>

							<p>Meanwhile, Mitzi flipped through a newspaper.</p>

							<p>"Dock, you better get up," she said. "You gotta go pitch!"</p>

							<p>"What are you talking about?" he said. "I pitch tomorrow."</p>

							<p>Mitzi gave him the sports page. Ellis scanned the newsprint. Padres-Pirates. Doubleheader. Friday. <i>Today</i>. Game time: 6:05 p.m. Game 1 starter: Ellis, D.</p>

							<p>"Oh, wow," he said. "What happened to yesterday?"</p>

			        <h2 data-scroll>The electric kool-aid no-no</h2>

			        <p data-scroll><strong>Better question: What happened to Ellis?</strong> He was a 1970s sports icon, outspoken and controversial, loathed and adored. Charles Barkley with a touch of Ozzie Guillen. Ellis pitched in an All-Star Game. Was a World Series
			          champion. He played 10 major league seasons, won 138 games and was a key member of the 1976 New York Yankees. He was a husband, a brother, an uncle and a father. He later became a drug counselor, working with addicts, inmates and troubled
			          youth. "If I had never met Dock, I would probably be dead or doing life [in prison]," said John Shandy, a 35-year-old Long Beach resident and recovering addict who was counseled by Ellis while incarcerated. "There's no doubt about that in
			          my mind whatsoever. That dude changed my life. He changed my world." </p>

			        <p>Ellis died of complications stemming from chronic liver disease in a Los Angeles hospital on Dec. 19, 2008. He was 63. To this day, he is sorely missed by those who knew and loved him. His widow. Former teammates. Childhood friends.
			          Legendary skateboard and music photographer Glen E. Friedman, who as a child met Ellis at New York's Shea Stadium, struck up a friendship and later dedicated his first book to the pitcher.</p>

			        <p>Not surprisingly, all of this has been forgotten.</p>

			        <p>The first line in Ellis' Los Angeles Times obituary reads, "� the former major league pitcher who claimed to have thrown a no-hitter while on LSD." Claimed? Ellis didn't claim. Ellis expounded. Go to YouTube. Use Google. Type "Dock Ellis
			          and the LSD No-No." You'll find a popular, award-winning No Mas short film about the game, illustrated and animated by artist James Blagden and featuring audio from a 2008 NPR interview of Ellis by Donnell Alexander and Neille Ilel. A
			          mash-up of popping, psychedelic colors and stark, black-and-white drawings, the film depicts the pitcher as a literal human cartoon -- when an animated Ellis covers a grounder at first base, he yelps, "I just made a touchdown!"</p>

			        <p>This fits.</p>

			        <p>After all, Ellis could have called in sick. Stayed in Los Angeles. Never bothered with catching an afternoon flight to San Diego, let alone catching a cab to the stadium. Barring that, he could have kept his mouth shut. Instead, Ellis
			          recorded a 2-0, no-hit victory against the Padres -- and 14 years later, the pitcher confirmed to reporter Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he had played the game on acid. Smizik had asked. He knew to ask because he was
			          working off a tip. A tip from Pirates fan David Lander, better known as the actor who played Squiggy on "Laverne &amp; Shirley." Stranger things have happened.</p>

			        <p>For instance, Ellis' claiming that he received the LSD in question from Leary himself.</p>

			        <p>True story: In the summer of 1999, Ellis became the inaugural member of the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals. Based in Pasadena, Calif., the reliquary is a sort of people's bizarre Hall of Fame, an organization with no permanent
			          home and an eccentric collection of baseball artifacts that includes the jockstrap worn by 3-foot-7 pinch hitter Eddie Gaedel, who walked in his only major league plate appearance. The morning before Ellis' induction ceremony at the city's
			          public library, reliquary executive director Terry Cannon met the retired pitcher by the large sculpture of Jackie Robinson that stands outside City Hall.</p>

			        <p>Ellis told Cannon that Leary -- a former Harvard psychology professor who championed the use of psychedelic drugs and once played a softball game in Mexico while tripping -- had been interested in researching the effect of LSD on
			          professional athletes. The professor had approached the pitcher: Would Ellis take a tab of LSD, play, and then report on the experience?</p>

			        <p>"I suppose Dock could have been pulling my leg," Cannon said. "But he was very straightforward about it."</p>

			        <p>Problem No. 1: Leary biographer Robert Greenfield said the anecdote is almost certainly bogus because, in 1970, Leary was locked up in a California prison on a drug conviction and didn't escape until September. Problem No. 2: Ellis told
			          Alexander that he got the acid from a UCLA laboratory. Problem No. 3: Leary's personal archivist, Michael Horowitz, said that the Leary-Ellis connection is highly unlikely -- but that when Horowitz first heard about the no-hitter, he bought
			          copies of the pitcher's 1971 Topps baseball card and gave one to Leary.</p>

			        <p>"Tim proudly carried it in his wallet, and showed it to any fans of sports and psychedelics he ran into," Horowitz said.</p>

			        <p>An Electric Kool Aid No-No. Did Ellis � or didn't he? Tony Bartirome, a former Pirates trainer and longtime friend of the pitcher, is skeptical. "Dock only gave up one hard hit that night [of the no-hitter], on a ball fielded by
			          [Pittsburgh second baseman Bill] Mazeroski," he said. "He might have said that just to jerk somebody off."</p>

			        <p>Maybe so -- not that it really matters. By now, the myth and man have become inseparable. So far this season, major league pitchers have thrown six no-hitters and three perfect games. None resonate like Ellis' long, strange trip. For the
			          psychedelically inclined, the mere notion of a LSD no-no stands as the counterculture answer to Babe Ruth's called shot, the pinnacle of mastering one's high. For everyone else, the game is <i>far out, man</i>, a funky bit of sports
			          folklore, appropriated and embellished, passed around like an old baseball card. Writer and eventual poet laureate Donald Hall included a full, non-bowdlerized version of the tale in a 1989 revision of his 1976 Ellis biography, "Dock Ellis
			          in the Country of Baseball." (In the original book, Hall replaced LSD with screwdrivers at the request of Ellis, who didn't want to antagonize Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.) Robin Williams riffed on the no-hitter during a stand-up
			          routine. A New York City art gallery displayed and sold a baseball coated with acid. Ellis became the subject of psychedelic paintings, T-shirts and surfboard designs. Blagden's Internet short film has been viewed more than 2.5 million
			          times. An online petition demands that Major League Baseball release broadcast footage of the no-hitter, and the lack of said footage has prompted conspiracy theories. (No such footage is believed to exist, although a Pirates team
			          photographer did record a few grainy, black-and-white minutes of Ellis throwing and slipping on the mound, later broadcast by HBO.)</p>

			        <p>Over time, the game has become the thing; the acid, the story. As for the pitcher himself?</p>

			        <p>Blotted out. Just like his pain.</p>
