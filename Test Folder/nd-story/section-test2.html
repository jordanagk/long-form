            <p class="section-intro">Notre Dame’s e-NABLE group had searched in vain for nearly a year for a child in need of an artificial hand. The informal student club, which a few dozen engineers formed to create 3D printed hands, had gone
              dormant.</p>
            <p>Then in February, Michael Skinner needed a ride home from a formal event during Junior Parents Weekend and called for an Uber. Driver Doug Anderson picked up Skinner and his mother. An outgoing New Jersey native, Skinner asked Anderson
              about his family.</p>
            <p>Skinner couldn’t believe his luck when Anderson told him about adopting a daughter from China who was born with half a palm and only one finger on each hand.</p>
            <p>Neither could Anderson.</p>

            <p>Anderson, 58, a public school teacher, retired early to take care of his four adopted children, including three with special needs. He drives for Uber for the extra cash and because he likes to socialize. He and his wife, Mary, had
              looked into prosthetics for their 11-year-old, Tori, but several hospitals said they weren’t practical for a growing child: too expensive and quickly outgrown. Then Skinner landed in his car.</p>
            <p>“I’m a very spiritual man,” Anderson says, “and I think that God absolutely has his hand in all of this kind of stuff. Mary and I have been … not frustrated … but wishing as parents that we could do a little bit more. So that God made
              it all line up like that, that’s no coincidence for me.”</p>

            <p>But it can be hard to get the paper to stay still when she writes. And her new bike has hand brakes. An artificial hand would make throwing easier. Tori is a little shy, but she says she’s willing to give the colorful contraption a
              try.</p>
            <p>“If there’s three or four things she can do with it that she can’t do now, that would be great,” says Cole Grabowski, the e-NABLE group’s president. “It’s good for us because it’s hands-on problem solving. It’s a great opportunity that
              I’m excited about.”</p>

            <p>Strebinger had hoped to access the software so the students could learn how to manipulate the design to custom-make Tori’s hand. But the e-NABLE software can only be sized, not altered. So Grabowski got himself certified on a band saw
              in the Stinson-Remick workshop.</p>
